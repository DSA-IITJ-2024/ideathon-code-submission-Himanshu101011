**Drug Interaction Prediction with Real-World Evidence Integration
This Python script predicts drug interactions using machine learning techniques and incorporates real-world evidence (RWE) into the analysis. The script uses the scikit-learn library for machine learning tasks.

Usage
Place your datasets in CSV format in the same directory as the script:
drug_interaction_data.csv: Dataset containing drug interaction information.
adverse_effect_data.csv: Dataset containing adverse effect information.
real_world_evidence_data.csv: Dataset containing real-world evidence.
Run the script drug_interaction_prediction.py.
Workflow
Load and Preprocess Datasets:
Load drug interaction, adverse effect, and real-world evidence datasets.
Handle missing values by dropping rows with NaN values.
Merge Datasets:
Merge drug interaction and adverse effect datasets based on the common column 'Drug'.
Feature Engineering and Model Training:
Extract features from the merged dataset (e.g., 'Drug', 'InteractingDrug', 'Effect') and target variable ('InteractionType').
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train a Random Forest Classifier model on the training set.
Model Evaluation:
Make predictions on the testing set using the trained model.
Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy score.
Incorporating Real-World Evidence:
Merge the existing dataset with the real-world evidence dataset based on the common column 'PatientID'.
Further feature engineering by incorporating additional features from real-world evidence (e.g., 'Age', 'Gender').
Retrain the Random Forest Classifier model with the augmented dataset.
Evaluate the model's performance with real-world evidence using accuracy score.
Output
The script prints the accuracy of the model in predicting drug interactions.
It also prints the accuracy of the model after incorporating real-world evidence.**
